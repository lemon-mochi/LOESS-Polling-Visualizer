Based on the alignment of the dates, it appears they may be formatted as text. This is usually happens to me when copying and pasting.

Try this:

Highlight the dates giving you issues. (Not the formulas)

Go to the Data tab

Click on Text to columns

Keep it on delimited, then next

uncheck all delimiters, then next

choose date or general, and finish

This should force the formatting as numbers. Let me know if this helps!
